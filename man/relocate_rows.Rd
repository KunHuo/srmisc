\title{Relocate specified rows to a target position in a data frame}
\usage{
relocate_rows(data, which, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame whose rows need to be reordered.}

\item{which}{Rows to move. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Numeric vector of row indices
\item Logical vector of same length as \code{nrow(data)}
\item Character vector of row names (if rownames exist)
}}

\item{to}{Target position (1-based index) where the selected rows should be moved.
Must be between 1 and \code{nrow(data) - length(which) + 1}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with rows reordered as specified.
}
\description{
This function reorders rows in a data frame by moving specified rows to a
designated position while preserving the relative order of other rows.
Supports numeric indices, logical conditions, and row names for row selection.
}
\details{
The function first removes the specified rows from their original positions,
then inserts them at the target position. All other rows maintain their
relative order. This is different from simple sorting operations.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(ID = 1:5,
                 Name = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"),
                 Score = c(85, 92, 78, 88, 95))

# Move rows 3 and 5 to position 2
relocate_rows(df, c(3,5), 2)

# Move high-scoring rows to the top
relocate_rows (df, df$Score > 90, 1)

# Move last row to first position
relocate_rows(df, nrow(df), 1)
